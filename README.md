# 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to my 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! This repository contains all the code and solutions for the daily challenges I completed as part of the [30-Day JavaScript Challenge on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the 30-day JavaScript challenge. Each day focuses on different aspects of JavaScript, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics. My goal is to improve my JavaScript skills through hands-on practice.

## Challenges
Each challenge folder contains:

- `index.html`: The HTML file for the challenge.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for the challenge.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the challenge.
- `README.md`: A brief description of the challenge and what was learned.

## Installation

To run the challenges locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/30-day-js-challenge.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired day's challenge folder:

    ```bash
    cd 30-day-js-challenge/day1
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the challenge in action.

## Usage

Each day's challenge can be viewed by opening the corresponding `index.html` file in a web browser. The solutions and explanations for each challenge can be found in the respective `README.md` files within each day's folder.
